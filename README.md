# refactoring-assignment

This is the Sinov8 Refactoring assignment which contain a couple of files each with some test.

# What we are checking in these tests are:
1) Attention to small details
2) Spelling
3) Refactoring Skills
4) Ability to spot obvious improvements and logic mistakes
5) Ability to write good readible code by using proper function and variable names and by using the least amount of code neccesary to get the functionally desired output.

# What we are NOT checking:
1) NOTE - Technical correctness or technical mistakes such as referring to a method that doesn't exists in the PHP/Laravel environment.

This code is all Psuedo code and doesn't need to run. We are looking at style and logic.

# Instructions
* Please create a corresponding file for each test file in the PhpAnswersDirectory.
* You can copy the files as starting point if you want.
* You are welcome to add methods, remove methods etc, in fact it is encouraged to do so if required.
